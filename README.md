Personal website created with Wordpress.org, hosted on Bluehost.com 💻

Project start date: June 21, 2024

This is a personal portfolio that integrates my blog site and tutoring service. I'm using the self-hosted version of Wordpress to allow for more flexible customization and monetization options. Instead of coding from scratch, I'm taking advantage of some automation and design tools from WordPress to optimize the blogging functionality. This is mainly a visual art / UIUX design project, with sprinkles of web development. 

This website will mainly serve as:
- An interactive multimedia personal portfolio
- Extend my existing WeChat Publication (est. 2018) into an English and SEO-friendly version
- Host an official platform for my tutoring service

There is not a projected end date since I will be continuously posting new blog articles even after the initial launch is complete. The current plan is to complete 75 days of blogging ("75-Hard Blogging Challenge), starting on July 16 and ending on September 29, 2024.
